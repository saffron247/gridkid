"GridKid" was a project created by Dr. Chris Johnson for the "Programming Languages" course at James Madison University. GridKid is a primitive spreadsheet application that is capable of using simple mathematical operations, variables, a limited number of functions, and brief logic operations. This is my implementation, created in Ruby.

My walkthrough of the last update to GridKid (and thus the finished version) can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20N7Ec3g8HM

All code in this project is mine.
